Hi! I'm keli5. I write software for myself or others to use, out of necessity or boredom. Check out [LettersBot](https://github.com/keli5/lettersbotpy), my biggest and best Python project.<br>I'm extremely familiar with JavaScript, and quickly trying to improve with Python.

## What will I find here?
I only have a few actual active repositories. Some are just little snippets of code written for a few specific people. Some are meant for public use, like LettersBotPY. I'll gladly look at contributions to any repo, I'm always looking to improve, whether it's JS, Python, HTML or anything else I've made public.

## Contact(?)
Your best bet for getting a hold of me is on Discord: letters#1900<br>
There are no other good (consistent) methods that I use at the moment.
